## Security Considerations

### Network Security

#### WiFi Configuration
- Use WPA3 or WPA2 encryption
- Avoid open or WEP networks
- Consider network isolation for IoT devices
- Regularly update WiFi passwords

#### Firebase Security
- Enable Firebase security rules
- Use authentication for production deployments
- Regularly rotate API keys
- Monitor access logs for suspicious activity

#### GSM Communication
- Validate SMS sources before processing
- Implement rate limiting for SMS commands
- Use encrypted communication when possible
- Monitor for unusual network activity

### Device Security

#### Firmware Protection
- Enable secure boot on ESP32 (production)
- Use encrypted firmware storage
- Implement rollback protection
- Regular security updates

#### Physical Security
